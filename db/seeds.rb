# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# u1 = User.create!(username: "billy", email: "billy@mail.com", description: "a guy named billy", location: "New York City")
# u2 = User.create!(username: "timmy", email: "timmy@mail.com", description: "a guy named timmmy", location: "Los Angeles")
