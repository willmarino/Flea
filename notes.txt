- changed how products are filtered out into rows
- might have to change how cur categories are stored/changed
- need to change how everything is fetched, should be when the main mounts, not when the header mounts

- I can generate three or however many categories with one dispatched action on mount of main
    - I want to have the generation of categories on mount of main, and have the rows filter their products by
    going through the generated categories and checking if they are already in use. If they are not, I use grabbyrow,
    or rather a modified version of it to grab the 6 products I need per row.
      - pertinent questions: what is the best way to generate the categories initially?
      - pertinent questions: how do I tell each row which category to use from those selected? (manual inline prop)
